# AWS Account Management

## Organization 

AWS Organization is a **global service**, because Organization group the multiple accounts together.

You can **invite an existing account** to the Organization or **create new account** directly from there. 

### Management account

Management account is the account you use it to create an Organization. 

You just need to got AWS Organization console > click on **Create Organization**

It is best practice to leave the management account under the root OU. But if you want, you can also move it to any OUs under Root OU.
