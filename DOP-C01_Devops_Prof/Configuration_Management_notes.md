## CloudFormation

### Resources

When you create a resource,   type and properties are required. 

### Outputs

CloudFormation uses Outputs to link two stacks, one stack can reference the value from another stack

First stack: Output component, define **Export name** and value

Second stack: To reference the output from the first stack, using function **fn:ImportValue**, the Export name as the value of the function 

### cfn-init

* cfn-init  (AWS::CloudFormation::Init) must be in the Metadata of a resource 

* cfn-init script is run in UserData

* UserData logs go to /var/log/cfn-init.log. 
  * If UserData is defined in cfn-init file, you can get UserData output in log  /var/log/cloud-init-output.log file. 
  * If UserData has been defined in cfn-init file, you can find UserData output in log /var/log/cfn-init.log file. cloud-init-output.log still exists, but UserData output is not in it. 

### cfn-signal and wait conditions

cfn-signal are also is run in UserData

**Wait condition** is a resource. When the wait condition receives the success signal, it will complete the creation. Then the stack goes to the completion stage.
