# IAM

## Access Advisor vs Access Analyzer

**Access Advisor**: in under an user or a role, shows permission granted and when last accessed.

**Access Analyzer**: For a AWS account or an organization, finds the resources can be accessed by external entity.

## IAM policy

### Power user policy: less privileged than administrator

**Note: Use "NotAction" instead of "Deny"**

- If we use deny for the first policy, then the second allow policy will never in effect, because explicit deny takes the precedence. 
- If we want to allow some of the actions but deny the rest, we can use "NotAction"
