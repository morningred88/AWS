# Elastic Beanstalk for SysOps

## Application vs environment

* When you create a new application in Beanstalk, you also create an environment for the application. 
* An application can have multiple environments, such as dev, qa and prod. Select you application, click create a new environment, we can create a second environment for the application.  
* Under Applications Tab, select one of the application, expand the tab on the left hand side, you can see **Application versions** tab. An Application can have multiple versions.
