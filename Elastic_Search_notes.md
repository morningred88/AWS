## Amazon Elasticsearch (Amazon ES)

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene

## How does Elasticsearch work?

You can send data in the form of JSON documents to Elasticsearch using the API or ingestion tools such as [Logstash](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/logstash/) and [Amazon Kinesis Firehose.](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) Elasticsearch automatically stores the original document and adds a searchable reference to the document in the clusterâ€™s index. You can then search and retrieve the document using the Elasticsearch API. You can also use [Kibana](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/kibana/), a visualization tool, with Elasticsearch to visualize your data and build interactive dashboards.
