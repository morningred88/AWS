## Route 53 - Creating the first DNS record

### Check IP Address of a DNS record

If you want to get the IP address of a domain name, use `nslookup` command in Windows cmd or git bash.

For example: check IP address of google

`nslookup google.com`
Server:  dsldevice6.attlocal.net
Address:  2600:1700:19a0:31b0::1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    google.com
Addresses:  2607:f8b0:4000:80e::200e
          142.251.46.142
